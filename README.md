~~Compass~~ Modern CSS Sassy Buttons
=========================

Based on the original [Compass Sassy Buttons Project](https://github.com/jhardy/Sassy-Buttons), but *without* Compass as a dependency and converted to the SCSS syntax. This project was created to remove the CSS vendor prefixes and Compass dependency, in favor of using tools such as [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to reduce legacy CSS weight.

This is not a gem, the `./scss` folder contains sass mixins which you can add to your project.

Note the author isn't really "maintaining" this project, but give a shout if there's something interesting you'd like to change.
